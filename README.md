# Data Mining - CISC5790 - Final Project
## Authors:
### John Chester | Jieun Jeong | Shelsy Saenz | Patricia Angeles

## Requirements:
* Install Python v3.9+
* Install the following packages:
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * scikit-learn
  * 

## How to Run:
* Using Jupyter
  * Navigate in Terminal/Command Prompt to the directory where you extracted the zip file.
  * Load the jupyter notebook, `John_Chester_CISC5790_HW3_NB.ipynb`, in an environment with the required packages, from above.
  * Run all cells.
  * The outputs from the cells will provide the recolored output images, as well as the SSE for k = {2, 3, 6, 10}.

## Contents:
* `John_Chester_CISC5790_HW3_NB.py` - the main python executable which runs the program
* `John_Chester_CISC5790_HW3_NB.ipynb` - the notebook I used to create the python program.
* `John_Chester_CISC5790_HW3_Written.pdf` - the written answers to questions 2-4.
* `README.md` - this file.
* `image.png` - the original image of the Eiffel Tower.
* `{k}_recolored_image.png` - the relevant recolored images of the Eiffel Tower - with k = {2,3,6,10}.

## Outputs:
* The outputs from the cells will provide the SSE for k = {2, 3, 6, 10}.
* The images will be saved to the same directory with naming conventions referencing the number of k.  They will include the SSE in the title of the chart, as well.
